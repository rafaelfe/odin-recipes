            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 cups water (for cooking beans)</li>
            <li>Water or broth (as needed for consistency)</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish</li>
            <li>Orange slices (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>PREPARATION</h2>
        <h3>Cook the Beans:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse the black beans under cold water and soak them overnight. Alternatively, use the quick soak method by bringing the beans to a boil, boiling for 2 minutes, and soaking for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, combine the soaked beans, bay leaves, and 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the beans are tender (about 1 to 1.5 hours). Add more water as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prepare the Meats:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In a separate pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Sauté the onions and garlic until softened.</li>
            <li>Add the pork shoulder, smoked sausage, chorizo, and bacon. Cook until the meats are browned.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Combine Meats and Beans:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the cooked meats to the pot of beans. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Simmer for an additional 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Adjust Consistency:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the feijoada is too thick, you can add water or broth to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Serve:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the bay leaves before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve the feijoada over rice, garnished with chopped cilantro or parsley.</li>
            <li>Accompany with sautéed collard greens and farofa on the side.</li>
            <li>Traditionally, feijoada is served with orange slices, which add a refreshing contrast to the rich flavors.</li>
        </ul>
